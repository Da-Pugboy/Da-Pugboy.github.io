    <h2>What is project "Infinity"?</h2>
    <p>I've made a challenge for all github user's that can right code using the JS library.
    I want <strong>you</strong> to make a game (using the JS library).
    <br> And in Three weeks i will look through all of the game's and choose a winner!<br>
    But there's a <em>catch</em> you have make a game <strong>never ends</strong>.
    <br> for example: Minecraft, Minecraft has <em>almost</em> infinite world generation.
